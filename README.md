# MRKT
## Introduction
MRKT is a cutting-edge command driven Twitter bot enabling remote access to real-time stock market data by harnessing web data parsing techniques. Designed with intention to empower novice traders by facilitating investment analysis and consolidating multiple data streams into an easily accessible and easy-to-read platform.

## Libraries Used
This project makes use of cURL, Gumbo, Twitter Development API v.2, and more.

## Latest Update (PLEASE READ)
After careful consideration, the MRKT bot is being discontinued from Independant Services for the forseeable future due to Twitter's (now ùïè) new pay-per-request API system announced beginning on February 9th, 2023, as well as the built-in CashTags Market features announced for April. This project was started in Fall 2022 and was completed in Early 2023. 

To those who did not get a chance to see MRKT in it's (short) lifespan, MRKT was an independant project with the goal of providing live stock data and market information remotely to Twitter users through direct messaging. The intent of MRKT was to help new traders become accustomed to retrieving data on current prices in live time without the need of analysing difficult-to-interpret websites, as well as allowing more advanced traders and professional users an alternative method to recieving direct information. 

Thanks to all who supported this project in its lifetime.
