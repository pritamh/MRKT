# MRKT
After careful consideration, the MRKT bot is being discontinued from Independant Services for the forseeable future due to Twitter's new API system announced to begin on February 9th, 2023, as well as it's Cashtags stock feature announced in April. This project was started in Fall 2022 and was completed in Early 2023. 

To those who did not get a chance to see MRKT in it's (short) lifespan, MRKT was an independant project with the goal of providing live stock data and market information remotely to Twitter users remotely through direct messaging. The intent of MRKT was to help new traders become accustomed to retrieving data on current prices in live time without the need of analysing difficult-to-interpret websites, as well as allowing more advanced traders and professional users an alternative method to recieving direct information. 

Thanks to all who supported the bot in it's lifetime.
